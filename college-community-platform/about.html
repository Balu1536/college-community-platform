            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The college owes its existence to the keen interest of Late Kandula Obul Reddy to develop technical education in Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. With a view to translating his noble ideal of imparting technical education into reality, a Technical Training Institute at Vempalli, Kadapa District was started in 1979 under the aegis of Sri Kandula Obul Reddy charities. It is in the year 1980 that K.S.R.M. College of Engineering was established to perpetuate the memory of Late Sri. Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, youngest son of Late Sri Kandula Obul Reddy. Sri Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, a brilliant student of III year Mechanical Engineering at Delhi College of Engineering, New Delhi, met with his untimely death in a scooter accident on 18th Oct, 1979.</p>
            <p>The college was formally inaugurated on 14 November 1980 by Sri T. Anjaiah, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and it started functioning from the academic year 1980-81.</p>

With the concerted efforts of the Management and the Successive Principals, the departments have been strengthened year after year and the intake has steadily been increased to 1080 by the year 2014.</p>
            <p>Furthering its sphere of activity, the college started post graduate programmes in CAD/CAM (ME), Geo-technical Engineering (CE) in the year 2004, Power Systems (EEE) & Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) during 2010-11 and Digital Electronics and Communication Systems (ECE) in 2011-12 respectively. The branches have constantly been strengthened by increasing the intake from time to time. This reflects one aspect of the progress and development of the college.</p>
