            <p>Do you ever feel like your study habits aren't quite where they should be? Are you having problems retaining the information you learn in class, or feel like your current study schedule isn't working for you?</p>

            <p>Don't worry – not all is lost! While there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach when it comes to studying effectively, there are plenty of tricks you can use to improve your recall, focus, and long-term memory. But don't forget: everyone has different ways of learning. The best way to study for you might look different from the methods used by friends or other people in your course.</p>

            <p>You probably are already on the right path to study success and will just benefit from a few tweaks here and there. Whether you're nearing the end of high school or midway through a university degree, we can help with these handy tips.</p>

            <p>And if you are a KSRM student, we can help you achieve your full potential by developing your confidence, academic ability, and study skills. With our support, you can develop the skills needed to excel at university.</p>

            <h2>Here are our top tips to help you study effectively – take these and roll with them over your next exams!</h2>

            <h3>1. Get Organised</h3>
            <p>Sometimes the most effective steps are also the simplest. You may find some simple hacks will set you up well and make studying a lot easier.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Invest in a diary, and use it to take control of your calendar and keep track of current assignment deadlines.</li>
                <li>Bring all the material and devices you need to class, so you can participate. You may find it helpful to pack your bag and prepare any meals the night before, so you’re ready to go first thing in the morning.</li>
                <li>Create a study timetable that breaks down your revision into manageable chunks. If you're in exam time, planning short, focused study sessions around your exams helps reduce stress and keeps you on track.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Don’t Skip Class!</h3>
            <p>Missing class can really hurt your progress and be detrimental to your learning – and therefore achieving your study goals. Whether you're in high school or university, it's important not to fall into the trap of ditching your classes. It leaves gaping holes in your notes and even bigger gaps in your subject knowledge.</p>

            <p>At KSRM, our learning model is designed to give you more time to work, see your family and friends, engage in hobbies, go to the gym, and fulfill other commitments.</p>

            <p>Rather than juggling four subjects at once, you’ll concentrate on one unit (subject) over a four-week ‘block’ period. You’ll attend three-hour workshop-style classes, three times a week.</p>

            <p>The rest of your time can be used to study, work, socialise – whatever is most important to you.</p>

            <p>It's a little different from learning in high school, but with this flexible model, you can stay on top of your studies while still living your life. You won't need to skip any!</p>

            <h3>3. Take Notes</h3>
            <p>Here's a top study tip: Practise active listening. This is where you focus on what your teachers are saying in class and take notes as needed.</p>

            <p>Active listening will keep you engaged during class – plus you can refer to these notes later as you further refine your study technique, whether it's high school or uni.</p>

            <p>This helps store important information in your long-term memory. Plus, these notes will be really helpful to refer to when you’re completing assessments and assignments.</p>

            <p>You might find it handy to condense your notes after class, so they’re clear and easy to read. Underline or highlight key points. If anything doesn’t make sense, you can seek clarification from your teacher.</p>

            <p>To further cement this knowledge into your brain, you can create visual aids like flow charts and mind maps to help simplify information. For some students, these visual aids help them remember complex information and study more effectively.</p>

            <p>If you do miss a class (or find yourself daydreaming – don't worry, it happens!), ask a study buddy or classmate if you can refer to their notes. This will ensure there are no gaps in your own notetaking.</p>

            <h3>4. Talk to Your Teacher & Ask Questions</h3>
            <p>Your teacher is, in a way, a resource who is there to be used! Squeeze as much as you can out of your teachers before your revision period at home starts – they won't be there forever.</p>

            <p>And at KSRM, the learning model allows you to focus on one subject at a time. As you'll be learning in a workshop-style class rather than a giant lecture theatre, you'll have the opportunity to get to know your teacher.</p>

            <p>You can take advantage of this interactive learning environment by asking questions during or after class, where you can get immediate feedback.</p>

            <p>Teachers can further clarify any topics you find confusing. You may even be able to get further direction on assignments before submitting.</p>

            <p>Your teacher will no doubt be impressed with your initiative and happy to help.</p>

            <h3>5. Space Out Your Studying</h3>
            <p>One of the most effective ways of studying is to carve space out between sessions.</p>

            <p>If you break up your study load over several days, you’ll retain information far more readily than if you crammed it into your head during one long session.</p>

            <p>This can help deeply ingrain information, letting it marinate and allowing you to retain it for the long term.</p>

            <p>You’ll find you achieve much better results for it.</p>
