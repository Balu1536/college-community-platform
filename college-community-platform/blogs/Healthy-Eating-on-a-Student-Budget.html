    <h1>Healthy Eating on a Student Budget</h1>
    <p>Eating healthy while managing a tight budget can be challenging for students. However, with some planning and smart choices, you can maintain a nutritious diet without breaking the bank.</p>

    <h2>1. Plan Your Meals</h2>
    <p>Take some time each week to plan your meals. This will help you avoid impulse purchases and ensure you have all the ingredients you need. Consider batch cooking to save time and money.</p>

    <h2>2. Make a Shopping List</h2>
    <p>Before heading to the grocery store, create a shopping list based on your meal plan. Stick to the list to avoid buying unnecessary items that can add to your expenses.</p>

    <h2>3. Buy in Bulk</h2>
    <p>Purchasing items in bulk can save you money in the long run. Look for bulk bins for grains, nuts, and dried fruits. Just be sure to store them properly to avoid spoilage.</p>

    <h2>4. Choose Seasonal Produce</h2>
    <p>Fruits and vegetables that are in season are often cheaper and fresher. Visit local farmers' markets or grocery stores to find seasonal produce that fits your budget.</p>

    <h2>5. Cook at Home</h2>
    <p>Eating out can quickly drain your budget. Cooking at home not only saves money but also allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes. Try simple recipes that require minimal ingredients.</p>

    <h2>6. Use Coupons and Discounts</h2>
    <p>Take advantage of coupons, student discounts, and loyalty programs offered by grocery stores. These can help you save money on your grocery bills.</p>

    <h2>7. Stay Hydrated</h2>
    <p>Don't forget to drink plenty of water! Staying hydrated is essential for your health and can help you avoid unnecessary snacking. Carry a reusable water bottle to save money on drinks.</p>

    <p>By following these tips, you can enjoy healthy meals while staying within your budget. Eating well is an important part of maintaining your energy and focus as a student!</p>
